Code Dojo #2

The master branch is where we got to on Tuesday.

Jon, 11 Apr 2013:
I've created a new branch (JonsUpdate) which is my attempt at progressing the code.
The first stage of this was refactoring to remove duplicate code.
I think that "D" and "M" could be added to the lookup tables, and we could then parse numbers up to 3000.
Since this is quick, I'll probably do that next, but also in the back of my mind is coping with invalid numbers...
